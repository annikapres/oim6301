    # Mini Project 1

    Your choice of project, what each one asks for, the due date and how it is graded are on the Mini Project 1 page of the course site, linked from the calendar. This notebook is the shape to build it in. Keep the headings, and replace each line in italics with your own.

    Save it in your course repository as `projects/mp1/<your-tool>.py`, named for what it does, such as `loan-schedule.py`, and open it with `uv run marimo edit`.

    Many restaurant companies would use this to reorder food items for their inventory when stock levels run low, ensuring they never run out of essential ingredients, and so that it also doesn't go bad. This automated reordering system helps maintain optimal stock levels, reduces manual tracking efforts, and minimizes the risk of running out of critical ingredients during peak business hours.

    ## 2. My Plan Before AI

    *Before you ask your agent anything, write how you would solve it: the steps, in order, in plain words, in five lines or more. Then answer these two questions:*

    - *What does your loop carry from one step to the next, the way a running total carries its sum?*
    - *Which check will you use in section 6, and which two numbers should agree?*

    *Commit this notebook with the message `mp1: plan before AI`.*

    I would solve these steps first by looking at daily demand : take the starting stock amount and start subtracting the daily demand. Keep in mind that it takes 3 days to deliver the 100 cartons, so have to keep the amount in stock above 40-60 before ordering the next shipment, since they they could go through 8-20 in a day. Then simulate day by day using a loop, tracking the current stock level, pending orders, and their arrival dates.

    Loop would carry the leftovers of the day before into the next as the current stock point and then subtract that day's demand to get the new stock level. When the running stock gets close to the reorder threshold (around 40-60 cartons), trigger a new order of 100 cartons, but remember it won't arrive for 3 days, so the stock will keep depleting during that lead time before the new shipment lands. Orders that have been placed but not delivered are tracked until their arrival day.

    I would check this in section 6 by making sure the total number of units sold plus the total number of units lost equals the total demand over the 30 days. The two numbers that should agree are total demand = total sold + total lost

    Copy in the default inputs for your project from the Mini Project 1 page. If you chose your own project, type your data in here, or ask your agent to generate it with `faker`. The required part reads no file.
